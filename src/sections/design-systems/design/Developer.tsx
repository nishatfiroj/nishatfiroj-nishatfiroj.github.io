    As one of 4 developers in a UI/UX department of over 100 designers,
    researchers, and product owners, I have big shoes to fill.
    <ul>

      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborating with designers to provide perspectives on how to build
        robust, plausible, and accessible UI/UX flows
      </li>
    </ul>
