    As one of 5 developers in the design department, and as the only female
    developer, I have heavy shoes to fill.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scarce developers + massive population of designers = broadened
        expectations of limited developers
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborating with designers to provide perspectives on how to build
        robust, plausible, and accessible UI/UX flows
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Grid>
